Web UI Testing:-

Bug Report:-
1. In Full name, country and URL text box when we click on that text box the placeholder text should not be hide
2. As per business requirement all fields are mandatory but I can save without entering the mandatory fields
3. If I enter any other name and click to save the information then I can view in success message but full name won't be change

Note:-
1. If you want run the test case please change the chromedriver path because it's my local machine path
2. In second test case I pass my name but test case is failed because of in message politician name won't be changed. You can see in the console with the full details.
   I put the assertion for that condition. If test case is failed then you can see in the console.
